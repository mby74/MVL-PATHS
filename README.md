# MVL-PATHS


Welcome to the Virtual Laboratory of Enhanced Mathematical Models—a computational platform designed to support the simulation, evaluation, and refinement of strategies aimed at mitigating the spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens.

This repository hosts a comprehensive suite of pre-developed, rigorously tested models that empower researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy analysts to explore the complex dynamics of disease transmission. The virtual laboratory enables the investigation of key drivers of pathogen spread and the estimation of the relative effectiveness of various control and prevention strategies in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
